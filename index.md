## Welcome  
My name is Cristian Chalarca, and I am a Computer Science student with a concentration in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I work as a Software Implementation Engineer, where I apply technical skills to real-world projects and collaborate with clients to deliver solutions.

This ePortfolio is a representation of my academic journey and the skills I have developed throughout the Computer Science program. It demonstrates my growth in three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each artifact highlights how I applied planning, problem-solving, and enhancement strategies to create more robust and professional solutions.

For example, my Software Design and Engineering enhancements improved code readability and maintainability, reflecting industry best practices. My Algorithms and Data Structures work strengthened validation and efficiency, showing problem-solving and logical thinking. Finally, the Database integration demonstrates my ability to implement real-time, persistent storage using Firebase, bridging academic work with practical applications.

These experiences, along with my coursework and professional role, have prepared me to contribute as a software engineer. I am committed to building applications that are not only functional but also maintainable, secure, and user-friendly. This portfolio provides evidence of those skills and the value I can deliver in professional environments.

This portfolio highlights my work in software design, algorithms, and databases, along with a complete inventory management application.
