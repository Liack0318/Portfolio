The artifact I chose is a cross-platform Inventory Management App that I started developing during my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The app allows users to register, log in, and access a dashboard to manage inventory items by adding product details such as name, quantity, category, price, and images. It was initially created using Java and Gradle in Android Studio, but for my ePortfolio, I have been rebuilding it from the ground up using Flutter to improve its design, usability, and cross-platform compatibility.
	I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my growth in mobile app development, user interface design, and my ability to implement clean, reusable code. One of the main reasons I included this app was because the enhancement process also allowed me to completely redesign the interface, making it look more professional and user friendly. I improved the layout, colors, iconography, and overall visual hierarchy to make the app easier to navigate and more visually appealing to users. I also improved the internal structure by separating logic into different screens, improving the navigation system, and adding user feedback components like input validation and snackbar alerts.
