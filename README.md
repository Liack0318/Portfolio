# Cristian Chalarca — Computer Science ePortfolio

Hi! I’m Cristian.  
I am a Computer Science student who loves building mobile apps and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.  

I started my journey studying Systems Engineering in Colombia, and now I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at SNHU. My focus is on software development and product management, with projects that highlight my skills in software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
